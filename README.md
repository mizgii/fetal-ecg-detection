# Fetal ECG Detection

This repository hosts the project for the Biomedical Signal Processing class at the University of Milan, focusing on fetal ECG detection from abdominal recordings. The project is based on the methodology described by Martens et al. (2007) and utilizes the PhysioNet 2013 Challenge dataset.

## Requirements

numpy == 1.23.4

matplotlib == 3.6.1

wfdb == 4.1.2

## Features
Signal preprocessing to enhance fetal ECG signals
Robust QRS detection adapted for fetal heart rates
Maternal ECG cancellation to isolate fetal signals

## Results
The implementation demonstrated promising results with variable detection accuracies, showcasing the potential for non-invasive fetal monitoring techniques.
